### Hi there, I'm Johnny ðŸ‘‹

I love building computers; it's Legos for adults! I want to bring that passion about computers (and tech in general) into my career, and thus I am in the midst of making a career transition into IT after being CompTIA A+ certified. This may be quite unorthodoxed, but this Github page will serve as a documentation of my own projects to gain experience in IT.
